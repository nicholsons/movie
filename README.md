A temporary repo to work out how to process the movie data.

Ignore test.py - that's a temporary file I was using to try out code. It doens't do anything currently.

csv_pddf_sqlite.py is the main file.

Your data is in the data directory.

I encountered various challenges with your database structure - see the comments at the top of the csv...python file.
